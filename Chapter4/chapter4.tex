\chapter{Discussion}
	Is there a Navigational Centre (Central Complex) in the Larval Drosophila?

	The similarities between the larval Central Complex and the adult Central Complex
        PB,EB,FB,NO

        Relation to accessory structures such as the LAL 
        Sensory Biases: olfaction vs photoreception
        Central Complex relation to the Mushroom Body (Learning and Memory Centre of the fly)
iii.	Functions of the Larval central complex 
1.	Network connectivity predictions
2.	Does biological data confirm our intuition?
3.	Conclusions about the neural functionality
iv.	What we now know
v.	Expectations for the future
vi.	Can this teach us universal components of multisensory integration 


\section{Multisensory integration}
 Gepner et al., 2015 demonstrated that Larvae  have to integrate visual and olfactory gradients, with convergence of these sensory systems before decision to act on them. 
 Exposed larvae to visual and olfactory input - blue light and optogenetic activation of appetitive ORNs
No competition between types of taxis. 
multisensory integration happens immediately before the decision to navigate. Only one coherent representation
Why is it that the information isnâ€™t processed at the time of decision making  - i guess because command like neurons
