\section{Strategy for identifying CX neuropils in the larval brain}

    In searching for a putative larval central complex, I used an iterative strategy guided by circuit features, lineage origin, relative location and morphology of the adult central complex. Since the adult brain presents fused hemispheres at the midline whereas the larval brain is characterised by a midline commusure, I placed more emphasis on searching for circuit motifs rather than anatomical similarity,  while preserving the relative spatial location of a CX neuropil as a constraint.  I focused on the following key circuit features:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Integration of sensory inputs: I searched for synaptic pathways corresponding to the adult's for integrating visual inputs into the PB, EB,FB and NO \citep{hulse2021connectome}; and gustatory inputs into the FB.
    \item Association between centers for memory and spatial navigation: I looked for the characteristic link between the MB, the center for associative memory, and CX neuropils, which includes synapses from MBONs (MB output neurons) to the FB, EB and NO in the adult fly.
    \item Recurrent intra-CX connectivity, such as with columnar neurons relating the PB with the FB and EB, or with the NO.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Identifying larva CXl neuronal lineages }
    The \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} central brain consists of stereotyped neural lineages, developmental-structural units of macrocircuitry formed by the sibling neurons of single progenitor cells, the neuroblasts \citep{Spindler2010Lineages}; a subset of these structures the CX \citep{Pereanu2011LineagesCX}. Starting with the currently identified set of quiescent, embryonic-born neurons present in the larval brain that develop into the adult CX during metamorphosis~\citep{andrade2019developmentally}
    I identified larval brain neurons satisfying imposed connectivity rules as per known circuit patterns across the adult CX neuropils \citep{wolff2015neuroarchitecture, wolff2018neuroarchitecture, franconville2018building, hulse2021connectome} (see \ref{CXAdultIntro}) .
    
    The hemilineages DM1, DM2, DM3, DM4, DM5 and DM6 are the core contributing lineages to the adult central complex columnar neurons (Table \ref{adultlineages}), and were therfore the first priority when searching for a putative CX at an earlier stage. I found that these lineages are present at the larval stage of drosophila under Ito Lee's naming in Table \ref{adultlineages}).  Several neuropil specific lineages (e.g. EBa1(DALv2) for the EB see \ref{adultlineages}) also exist at the in the larva. In total, 12 of the 15 lineages contributing to the adult CX also exist in the larva, under different naming., I found that 9 of them contribute neurons to the larval central complex, and they are summarised in (Table \ref{lineagemap}).  I used these 9 lineages as a starting point to find a putative CX neuropils in the larva.

    I broadened the search beyond these lineages based on the expectation that some larval neurons may have been recruited to CX structures but would later take another identity in the adult, as is known for larval MB neurons \citep{truman2023metamorphosis}, on the basis of matching synaptic connectivity patterns as observed in the adult (see Section \ref{CXAdultIntro}) ; for example, for EB Ring neurons I looked for neurons with recurrent axo-axonic synapses with each other and with Wedge neurons, where their axon is located at the most anterior end of the brain neuropil, at an intermediate dorso-ventral position just anterior to the MB medial lobe.

    I found several neurons that satisfied said criteria, and were therefore classified as central complex neurons (see Section \ref{CXLarva}). A comprehensive list of their lineages as well as the above lineages is shown in Table \ref{larvallineages}.

    \subsection{Connectivity of CX neurons}
    %CONNECTIVITY
    When investigating circuit motifs across the larval CX, I explored connectivity with established brain regions, starting with sensory input areas such as the Optic lobe(OL), and progressing to regions such as the MB, the LAL and the Lateral Horn (LH).  I categorised individual cells on the basis of the location of thier processes:  where a neuron receives synaptic input (location of its dendrites) and sends output synapses (location of its axons) (for nomenclature see methods section \ref{nomenclature}).

    %SENSORY
     \textbf{ textit{Sensory Inpus} }
    The central complex is known primarily for visual input processing, therefore in the larva I looked at neurons downstream of photoreceptors.section \ref{CXvisual}. I investigated cells immediately connected to visual projection neurons (vPNs) which are directly connected to photoreceptors. Several of these neurons have been catalogued as Protocerebral Bridge (see section \ref{PB}) or Noduli(see section \ref{NO}) neurons. 
    In additon to visual input, I found that olfactory input is integrated by all the larval CX neuropils indirectly via the Lateral Horn(LH) and the Mushroom Body through convergence neurons(CNs; which integrate learnt valences from the MB and innate valences from the LH \citep{eschbach2021circuits}) or MB output neurons and MB input neurons \ref{CXMB}. This is in line with previous findings about the CX being integrative across multiple sensory modalities \citep{hulse2021connectome}. Since Gepner et al., 2015 demonstrated that Larvae  have to integrate visual and olfactory gradients, with convergence of these sensory systems before decision to act on them. I expected there would be a structure recieving input from these modalities and used information such as lineage membership to figure out if these could be central complex neurons. 

    %OTHER NEUROPILS
    \textbf{\textit{Connectivity between CX Neuropils and Accessory Structures}}
    Columnar and horizontal neurons have stereotyped connectivity patterns within the CX, being connected between themselves or with other accessory structures (e.g.LAL). To be able to define these, I categorised them similarly to how they have been categorised in the literature. For naming, I adapted Wolff et al., 2015 nomenclature, and named them on the baisis of the location of input synapses (.d for dendrites) and the location of their output synapses (.b for axonal bouttons). Once the synapses for each neuron were mapped, I categorised them on the basis of their location within the CX neuropils and relative to accesory structures as per Figure \ref{CXclasses}.  As such I devided them into Intrinsic Neurons(those whose inputs and outputs are located within CX neuropils), Local Neurons (cells whose inputs and outputs located within the same neuropil), Input Neurons (those that send only dendrites processes within the CX and output outside of it) and Output Neurons: Cells that send denritic inputs outside of the CX but output onto the CX neuropils. Since the CX of the larva is numerically reduced, I grouped Intrinsic and Local neurons, and named these \textbf{Core CX neurons} for a more concise, cohesive analysis of the CX network. There are 15 pairs of CX core neurons, all of which are presented in Table \ref{CXCoreNeurons}. For a comprehensive understanding of the connectivity patterns of these neurons, they have been written in a nomenclature adapted from Wolff et al., 2015 \citep{wolff2015neuroarchitecture}. I classified neurons using the suffixes ".b" (axon boutons) and ".d" (dendrites) for CX neuropils.
    Hence, a neuron annotated as NO.b projects its axon into the NO, and likewise, a neuron annotated as FB.d places its dendrites in the FB.
    As such, neurons that are both .b and .d for CX neuropils are the CX Core neurons.

    \subsection{Protocerebral Bridge}
    \label{PB}
        In searching for the larval PB, I expected two sets of neurons: columnar and horizontal. In larva, four central complex lineages contribute columnar neurons, a subset of which position their dendrites at a posterior-dorsal location. I could not find a central complex lineage that would contribute horizontal fibers at a posterior-dorsal location necessary to intersect and synapse onto the dendrites of the PB columnar neurons; however, I found a larval lineage (DALv1) whose axons are bilateral and project to the appropriate area, and is developmentally related to another central complex lineage (DALv23). This suggests that neurons from non-central complex lineages may be recruited temporarily during the larval period, in a pattern reported so far for the mushroom body (see Discussion; \citep{truman2023metamorphosis}). 

        \subsubsection{Larval PB Horizontal fibers}
    Among neurons of the DALv1 lineage, 4 left-right pairs (named HF-PB for "Horizontal Fiber PB") project their axons bilaterally and across the dendrites of the columnar neurons.
    3 of the 4 pairs present an unusual axon configuration: first, they project contralaterally to drop their first output synapses, with the axon then crossing the midline a second time to return back to the same ipsilaterally corresponding location to again drop presynaptic sites .
    This peculiar axon configuration is unique among all neurons of the entire brain of the larva~(\citep{winding2023connectome}) and suggestive of potentially a delay line for comparing left-right sensory inputs.
    The 4th pair first drops presynaptic sites ipsilaterally and then its axon crosses the midline until reaching the corresponding contralateral location to synapse again~(\ref{DALv1s}). These neurons are PB.b neurons since they contribute axonal butons to the PB. Several of these neurons have their dendrites encolsed in the FB (are FB.d neurons), making them Core CX neurons. 

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figs/CX/DALV1s.pdf}
        \caption[PB Dalv1 Neurons]{\textbf{PB Horizontal Fibers (HF-PB).} Two types of horizontal fiber neurons are shown, each with a morphological reconstruction (top) and a simplified schematic (bottom). The mushroom body is shown in magenta. Input synapses (dendrites) are indicated by blue arrows, while output synapses (axons) are indicated by red arrows. Panel \textbf{A.} shows the 3 pairs of HF-PB1 neurons, characterized by a double-crossing axon; panel \textbf{B.} displays the single pair of HF-PB2 neurons, with outputs projecting only contralaterally; and panel \textbf{C.} the four bilateral pairs of HF-PB neurons shown together.}
        \label{DALv1s}
    \end{figure}

    % Relative to the root of their dendritic tree, which is ipsilateral, the first set of output synapses are found contralaterally. Then the axon crosses the midline a second time, returning to the ipsilateral hemisphere to establish more output synapses in a spatially symmetric way to the contralateral set of output synapses.

    The presynaptic outputs of DALv1 neurons are symmetric, in that they contact the same homologous pairs of left-right neurons which are predominantly neurons of the columnar system from the DM1-DM4 lineages.

    The axons of these 4 pairs of HF-PB neurons are tiled dorso-ventrally, falling into two bilaterally symmetric groups which I interpret as defining 2 + 2 bilaterally arranged PB compartments, each innervated by 2 pairs of axons (Figure \ref{DALv1s}C). 

    The dendrites of these 4 pairs of DALv1 neurons (HF-PB) are ipsilateral and dorsal, receiving polysynaptic inputs from vision and olfaction, like in the adult PB~(\citep{hulse2021connectome}). In the larva, I found that these multi-sensory inputs to the horizontal fibers of the PB are mediated by Convergence Neurons (CN-53 and CN-54, among others; \citep{eschbach2021circuits}) that, as their name indicates, integrate inputs from both Mushroom Body Output Neurons (MBONs) and from the Lateral Horn (LH) such as olfactory and visual PNs \citep{eschbach2020recurrent}). This circuit architecture indicates that sensory inputs arriving to the larval PB will have been modulated or gated by previously established associative memories, with implications for spatial navigation.

    Three more larval lineages contribute HF-PB neurons: the BLAvm (neuron SLR), the BLAd-OL (neuron MB2ON-63), and the DPMm2 (neuron ADC1),  with one pair of neurons each. 
    MB2ON-63 presents a bilateral axon similar to the 4th pair of HF-PB (DALv1), and an ipsilateral dendrite that integrates inputs from multiple convergence neurons (CN-54, CN-9), MBONs (MBON-c1, MBON-d1), and sensory PNs (olfactory mPN B1, visual PVL09).

    SLR presents a contralateral axon that spans both the FB and PB, and an ipsilateral dendrite that integrates inputs from MB2ON-63, CN-9, and the FB intrinsic neuron MB2ON-175 (see below), in addition to a long tail of weaker input from ascending neurons relaying information from the somatosensory system.

    ADC1 presents an ipsilateral dendrite projecting to the posterior brain and a bilateral axon circumscribed to the PB. These neurons integrate inputs from multiple sensory PNs (mPN B2, mPN 5 (also known as mPN BAmd1-g), mPN A1, and weakly from others), a convergence neuron (CN-35), MB2ON-94, and a few others weakly. Their axons target primarily HF-PB neurons (DALv1), but also convergence neurons  (CN-56, CN-15, CN-35).
 
        \subsubsection{Larval PB Columnar neurons}

    In the larva, the columnar system consists of neurons from 4 central complex lineages (DPMpm1, DPMpm2, DPMm1 and CM4) that also generate the columnar neurons of the adult (DM1, DM2, DM3 and DM4, correspondingly: these are the same lineages with different names for the larva and the adult for historical reasons).
    Larval columnar neurons present small, narrow dendrites circumscribed within the 2 + 2 compartments defined by the axons of the HF-PB (DALv1) neurons, from whom they recieve synapses. These are catalogued as PB.d neurons since they contribute their dendrites to the PB.

        \begin{figure}[H]

            \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figs/CX/PBcolumnar.pdf}

The mushroom body is shown in magenta. \textbf{A.} Neurons projecting from the PB to the NO (PB.d NO.b), with the NO neuropil shown in dark blue. \textbf{B.} Neurons projecting from the PB to the EB (PB.d EB.b), with the EB represented by the red structure beneath the mushroom body. \textbf{C.} Descending PB neurons projecting toward the SEZ or the VNC.}
            \label{pbcolumnar}
        \end{figure}

    Among the columnar neurons, a subset project their axons directly to the NO (Fig. \ref{pbcolumnar}A), and another subset project directly to the larval EB (Fig. \ref{pbcolumnar}B).

    I did not find among the larval columnar neurons any whose axon would project to more than one CX neuropil, despite such types being common in the adult~\citep{wolff2015neuroarchitecture, wolff2018neuroarchitecture, hulse2021connectome}.
    Beyond the canonical columnar neurons projecting to other CX neuropils, I found some whose axons descend directly to the SEZ or nerve cord~(Fig. \ref{pbcolumnar}C), and have been accordingly named 'PB descending' neurons. (N.B. These neurons go on to connect to descending neurons, but aren't themsevles descending neurons.

        \subsubsection{PB Horizonal and PB Columnar connectivity}
    With the PB columnar neurons having dendrites encolsed in the PB (PB.d) and the PB horizonlal neurons (HF-PB) sending output to the PB(PB.b), I expected there to be significant connectivity between the two types of neurons. Indeed a half of the HF-PB neurons are connected with columnar PB cells (\ref{PBconnections}).  Interestingly, only 2 pairs of neurons, both of HF-PB1 type, connected to every type of PB columnar neuron. Specifically a pair of HF-PB1 (annotated as HF-PB1\_1 in table \ref{PBconnections}) sends output synapses to 2 PB-NO (PB.d-NO.b) neurons, both of which are also second order MB output neurons (MB2ON-204 and MB2ON-241). The other pair of  HF-PB1 (HF-PB1\_2) send outputs to 1 PBtoEB (PB.dNO.b) neuron, which is a second order MB input neuron (MB2IN-195), as well as 2 pairs of PB Descending neurons.

    \subsection{Ellipsoid Body}
         \subsubsection{Larval EB Wedge neurons}
    In the larval brain, I found a group of 8 pairs of reciprocally synaptically connected neurons from larval lineage DALcl12, known to produce Wedge neurons in the adult, so I named them Wedge neurons (or W1-W8).
    Both their dendrites and axons are very small, and tiled medio-laterally, defining 8 compartments with one single neuron pair contributing to each (Fig. \ref{EBneurons}C).
    I found an additional pair of neurons from larval lineage DALv23 (which produces ring neurons in the adult) with the same connectivity pattern as Wedge neurons (Fig. \ref{EBneurons}B). All wedge neurons contribute both axons and dendrites to the EB, ,making them EB.d.b neurons, and Core CX neurons, accordingly.

    While Wedge neurons make both axo-dendritic and axo-axonic synapses onto each other (like the AL Picky LNs do; \citep{berck2016wiring}; see Table\ref{EBmatrix}), their dendrites integrate inputs from a variety of sources, including MBONs (MBON-e1, MBON-e2, MBON-g1, MBON-g2, MBON-b3, MBON-m1, and weak inputs from more), convergence neurons (CN-14, CN-25, CN-62, CN-38), and MB feedback neurons (FBN-13, FBN-19, FBN-21), indicating that the EB is intimately and intricately involved with the MB (see below).
    Wedge neurons, like the adult, receive further axo-axonic synapses from Ring neurons (see below; RN1/2, also known as FBN-20; and RN3).

        \end{figure}

         \subsubsection{Larval EB Ring neurons}

            I found one pair of neurons (RN3) of the larval BAmv1/2 lineage (corresponding to adult lineage LALv1 known to generate ring neurons) that receive visual input via PB columnar neurons, and reciprocally synapses axo-axonically with larval Wedge-neurons (Fig. \ref{EBneurons}A).
            Their axons are fully contained within the space defined by the wedge neurons.
            Similarly, I found two pairs of neurons (RN1/2) from the larval DALv23 lineage (adult EBa1 lineage, also known to generate ring neurons), synaptically connected like RN1/2 (Fig. \ref{EBneurons}B). I classified all of these as larval EB Ring neurons, all of them having both dendrites and axons inside the EB, making them EB.d.b neurons, and as such, CX Core neurons.

            \end{figure}

            \textbf{\textit{Additional EB.d Neurons}}
            There are seven more pairs of EB.d (neurons that contribute presynaptic sites to the EB) that didn't fall under ring or wedge neuron categories. Two of these are MB Dopaminergic neurons (DAN-d1 and DAN-g1), another 3 are LAL neurons(I refer to these as EB to LAL nerons) - these can be LAL.d LAL.b or LAL.d.b - and the last 2 are MB second order output neurons (see Appendix for more)%TODO ADD APPENDIX 

        \subsubsection{Connectivity between Ring Neurons and Wedge Neurons}
            In the adult, a key feature of nearly all ring neuron types(ER1-6)is their dense interconnectivity. Since ER neurons send output processes within the CX \citep{hulse2021connectome}, I deduced majority of them are axo-axonic. Interestingly, this is the exact pattern I observe in the larval ring neurons (RN1/2, RN3), with all these 3 neurons being reciprocally connected axo-axonically (Table \ref{EBmatrix}). 

            The larval EB wedge neurons (W1–W8) form a densely recurrent network, reminiscent of adult wedge EPG neurons. Every wedge pair is connected reciprocally, with the predominant motif being axo-dendritic synapses; axo-axonic contacts are also present but weaker and fewer in number. 

            Importantly, all eight wedge neuron pairs (W1–W8)synapse directly onto every identified ring neuron (RN1/2a,b and RN3), creating an all‑to‑all Wedge to Ring connectivity motif that closely mirrors the characteristic pattern observed in the adult EB (see Fig.~\ref{EBmatrix}). However, these connections are exclusivelyaxo-axonic.This dense, reciprocal coupling likely supports distributed representations and recurrent dynamics within the larval EB. 

            A summary of the connectivity motifs is given below; full pairwise counts and the axo-axonic versus axo-dendritic decomposition are shown in Fig. \ref{EBmatrix}. 

    \subsection{Fan-Shaped Body}
        In the larva, I found a number of putative FB horizontal/tangential cells originating in lineages known to contribute neurons to the adult FB. Characteristically, most present a bilateral axon closely wrapping around the midline, and an ipsilateral dendrite positioned within the superior dorsal protocerebrum (dorsal anterior neuropil) where they integrate numerous inputs from MBON axons, a pattern specific to the adult CX. Among the various neurons with dendrites within this very medial neuropil, I find neurons from lineages known to contribute to the adult FB and whose axons project to the putative larval NO, EB, PB and LAL.
        \subsubsection{Larval FB Tangential cells}
        I found a diverse and large collection of larval FB tangential cell types.
        All types contribute synapses rather specifically to the FB and are hence labeled as FB.b, a defining feature across them all.
        The somas originate in a number of larval lineages whose adult homologs  are known to contribute neurons to the adult FB (see above), but also a few from the nerve cord, projecting their ascending axons directly to the FB such as the pCC neurons (a cell type first reported in grasshopper \citep{goodman1984pCC} and later in the \textit{Drosophila} embryo \citep{jacobs1989pCC}). The axons of the pCC project to the ipsilateral FB. The set of ascending neurons isn't complete, for the ventral nerve cord (VNC) remains incompletely mapped.

        Among all neurons projecting their axons to the FB, many are brain neurons that do so with a typical bilateral horseshoe ('hs') axon, and hence I named then hs-FB, with a numeric label for each subtype.

            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=10cm]{Figs/CX/HS-FBneurons.pdf}

            \label{fig:HSFBneurons}
            \end{figure}

        The DM1-DM4 lineages that contribute to the adult CX also generate a number of FB tangential neurons in the larva (larval lineages DPMm1, DPMpm1, DPMpm2, and CM4-vm, respectively). Targeting the FB, there are several major subtypes. 
        
        First, 6 pairs of neurons (hs-FB.1) with a bilaterally symmetric axon that tightly lines the medial surface in a horseshoe shape, and with a smallish dendrite dorsal and slightly lateral to the FB, within the medial side of the superior protocerebrum (Fig \ref{fig:HSFBneurons}A). Second, 2 pairs of neurons (hs-FB.2) also with bilaterally symmetric axons but that target the more posterior-lateral FB and beyond into the larval PB, with also ipsilateral dendrites that extend anteriorly and ventrally along the neuraxis (Fig \ref{fig:HSFBneurons}B).
        Third, a pair of neurons (hs-FB.3) with bilateral axons placed towards the most posterior end of the FB and perhaps beyond, into the lateral side, and with small ipsilateral dendrites (Fig \ref{fig:HSFBneurons}C).
        The axons of all 6 pairs of hs-FB.1 neurons define the ventral layer of the FB, and the axons of the hs-FB.2 the dorsal one, which is shorter and more anterior. The hs-FB.3 axons project in between the other two types but also cover the posterior-dorsal area that hs-FB.2 doesn't (Fig. \ref{fig:HSFBneurons}D).  
        The larval BAla34 lineage generates sensory PNs, of which two pairs (hs-FB.4) present the typical bilateral axon and their dendrites collect inputs from the ventral posterior brain where ascending PNs from the somatosensory system (mostly mechanosensory) project their axons. One of the pairs is also NO.d (collects inputs from NO.b neurons) (Fig \ref{fig:HSFBneurons}E).
        The larval BAmd2 lineage contributes two pairs of neurons (hs-FB.5) with a bilateral axon and dendrites that cover a region medial but lateral to the FB, and also far more ventral (Fig \ref{fig:HSFBneurons}F).
        The larval DALl1 lineage contributes two pairs of neurons (hs-FB.6) with a bilateral axon and dendrites integrating inputs from the intermediate and lateral areas to the FB, primarily from neurons postsynaptic to ascending mechanoreceptive neurons like A00c \citep{ohyama2015multilevel}. A number of neurons presynaptic to hs-FB.6 are also labeled as FFNs and MB2INs, meaning they converge onto MB DANs, MBINs and OANs \citep{eschbach2020recurrent} (Fig \ref{fig:HSFBneurons}G).
        The larval CPa lineage contributes a pair of neurons (hs-FB.7) with a bilateral axon and dendrites that cover the most posterior end of the FB, or right outside, plus sparsely a space lateral to the FB, collecting inputs from polysynaptic pathways originating in somatosensory mechanoreceptive neurons  (Fig \ref{fig:HSFBneurons}H).
        Finally, the DPLal1-3 lineage contributes a pair of small neurons (ip-FB.1) with an ipsilateral-only axon targeting the most posterior lateral side of the larval FB, and with dendrites more lateral that integrate inputs from a variety of neurons, some of which are NO.d.

            % TODO Note the loop between FB and NO, with NO.d-FB.b and FB.d-NO.b neurons.

            By definition, all larval FB columnar neurons present dendrites in the FB (are FB.d), and are postsynaptic to FB.b neurons. I founda total of 9 types of FB.d neurons, all presented in Figure \ref{FBColumnar}. 

            \begin{figure}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=15cm]{Figs/CX/FBColumnar.pdf}

                \label{FBColumnar}
            \end{figure}


            In addition to generating FB tangential neurons, the DM1-DM4 lineages also contribute 5 pairs of FB columnar neurons. These neurons (FB.d1) are characterized by ipsilateral-only dendrites largely circumscribed to the FB (except for the Bushy neuron from the DPMpm1/DM3 lineage), and projecting their ipsilateral-only clutchy axons solely the NO (so they are FB.d-NO.b). Therefore, FB.d.1 neurons are specialized in relaying information from the FB to the NO hemilaterally. Among FB.d.1, there are 3 MB related neuron, namely CN-34, MB2ON-201 and MB2ON-204  \citep{eschbach2021circuits}. Importantly, 4 of the 5 FB.d1 pairs also send their dendrites to the PB, making them PB.d neurons as well, therefore they are PB.d-FB.d-NO.b and also core cx neurons. This is the closest version to the adult PFN, however the adult analogue would be PB.d-FBb.b-NO.b. %TODO refer figure with cx neurons analogues. 

            The DM lineage (larval CM4-vm lineage) further contributes 1 pair of neurons (FB.d4) with ipsilateral dendrites in the posterior FB and beyond into an area adjacent to the LAL medially, and a contralateral axon that descends into the VNC, dropping presynaptic sites from the SEZ to the most posterior abdominal segments. Within the brain, FB.d.4 synapses onto some NO.d neurons (e.g., MB2ON-200) and also onto CN-28 \citep{eschbach2021circuits}..

            The MB neuroblasts contribute 3 pairs of early-born, non-Kenyon cell neurons (the 'ni' for "non-intrinsic"), named FB.d2, with ipsilateral dendrites in the FB and a contralateral axon targeting exclusively the LAL.

            Then there are a collection of single pairs of neurons, each contributed by a different neuroblast, with dendrites in the FB and their axons targeting widely divergent neuropils, across the brain and also into the SEZ and VNC.

            The larval BLAv12 lineage contributes 1 pair of neurons (FB.d3) with ipsilateral dendrites in the FB and also more medially, and ipsilateral axons targeting exclusively the LAL.

            The larval DALcm12-v lineage (adult CREa1) contributes 1 pair of neurons (FB.d5) with ipsilateral dendrites in the FB and in the area adjacent but medial and ventral to the LAL, projecting their axons ipsilaterally from the NO to the medio-ventral brain and dorsal SEZ. The axons synapse onto a large number of NO.d neurons.

            The BAmv12-dor larval lineage contributes 1 pair of neurons (FB.d6) with compact ipsilateral dendrites within the FB, and a compact short ipsilateral axon immediately dorsal on the PB. The FB.d6 hence serve as a direct relay from the FB to the PB, synapsing onto half a dozen PB.d neuron types.

            The BAla12 larval lineage contributes 1 pair of neurons (FB.d7; also known as FFN-6, \citep{eschbach2021circuits}) with compact ipsilateral dendrites in the FB, and an ipsilateral axon that targets the superior anterior protocerebrum where it synapses profusely onto the dendrites of DANs and OANs of the MB (DAN-i1, DAN-j1, DAN-c1, OAN-g1). Hence, FB.d7 serves as a relay between the FB and the MB input neurons, conveying teaching signals for associative memories.

            The BLAl larval lineage contributes 1 pair of neurons (FB.d8) with ipsilateral dendrites within the FB but also extensively lateral to the FB, and with peculiarly curving axons that follow the neuraxis, closely apposed to the dendrites of some hs-FB subtypes (hs-FB.1, hs-FB.2, hs-FB.3) and synapsing onto them.

            The DPMl2 larval lineage contributes 1 pair of neurons (FB.d.9, also known as FB-LAL1) with ipsilateral dendrites on the posterior  hemilateral FB (with inputs from hs-FB.2, hs-FB.5, hs-FB.6) and also reaching into the PB (with inputs only from ADC1), and a contralateral axon targeting the LAL where they synapse onto LAL LNs, EB.d neurons, and multiple descending neurons (DNs) that project to the SEZ and VNC.

            Finally, 3 of the 4 pairs of HF-PB neurons (the ones with a doubly crossing axon) are all FB.d, namely, they have dendrites within the FB and receive numerous synapses from FB.d neurons, in particular subtypes hs-FB.2, hs-FB.5 and hs-FB.6 (with further but weaker inputs from other subtypes). This indicates that the PB horizontal fibers not only integrate inputs from multiple sensory systems and gated by MB outputs, but are also modulated by the FB.

        \subsubsection{Conectivity between FB Tangential and FB Columnar}
           In the adult, FB tangential neurons(FBt) arborize extensively across specific horizontal layers of the FB, conveying layer-specific synaptic inputs primarily sourced from accessory structures such as the CRE, SMP/SIP/SLP, and LAL, and have dense recurrence to the FB columnar FBc cells. Since in the larva there is a significantly numerically reduced FB, with no obvious layering and only one accesory structure structure (LAL), I couldn't draw straightforward analogies between the two networks, however I was curious if any general recurrence at all is present in the larval FB.  
           
           A significant recurrent connectivity across the larval FB is observed. All FB tangential neurons (hs-FBs) send synaptic outputs onto FB.d1, FB.d.2 and FB.d7, and all except for one (hs-FB.3) synapse onto FB.b.8 neuron. There are 5 hs-FBs (1,2,5,6 and 7) synapse onto FB.d3 and 5 others (hs-FB.2,3,6,7,8) send processes to FB.d.9. Finally, FB.d.4, FB.d5 and FB.d6 receive input from 3 or less hs-FBs. A summary of this connectivity pattern is shown in Table \ref{tab:fb-connectivity}.

         \subsubsection{Larval FB intrinsic neurons}

    % Neurons that are both FB.b and FB.d
    I found two pairs of neurons (MB2ON-125 and eDAN-2) that are both FB.d and FB.b, corresponding to the third type of adult FB neurons: the intrinsic.

    MB2ON-125 integrate inputs across many neuron types, from PB.d columnar neurons to LH output neurons.
    As the MB2ON-125 name indicates (see \citep{eschbach2021circuits}), it receives direct synapses from MBONs (just MBON-c1, but a strong connection).
    Fairly large, its dendrites span approximately the entire spatial domain of the putative larval FB.  Postsynaptically I find the CSD neuron \citep{berck2016wiring} and ascending neurons from the ventral nerve cord~(VNC), among many others such as FFN-31 (so-called feedforward neurons, from the MB perspective, that bring sensory inputs to MB DANs; \citep{eschbach2021circuits}).

    The second FB.d.b, eDAN-2, is a non-MB dopaminergic neuron (DAN) entirely circumscribed to the posterior-lateral end of the FB. This neurons was identified via immunohistochemistry and is described at length in section section \ref{CXDANs} on DANs of the CX below for details.
    
     \subsection{Noduli}
    \label{NO}

    In the larva I found a set of 21 neurons (10 pairs plus one unpaired) with highly compact, clutchy axons situated in the posterior ventral area of the brain, from lineages DPMm1 (DM1 in the adult), DALcm12, DPMl12, DPLc5, and BAMv12, as well as a few other larval lineages (Fig. \ref{cxneuropils}).
    I define the volume encapsulating all their clutchy axons as the putative Noduli of the larval \textit{Drosophila}, and labeled all these neurons as NO.b.

    Among the 21 NO.b neurons in the larva I find FB.d neurons (four pairs of the 5 FB.d.1 subtype including CN-34), convergence neurons (CN-6, CN-16/MBON-p1 \citep{eschbach2020recurrent}), neurons postsynaptic to MBONs (MB2ON-37, MB2ON-241), NO-looper (lineage BAmv12dor), MBON-p1 (a multi-compartment MBON of the MB vertical lobe; \citep{eichler2017complete}), and an unpaired neuron (DLPc lineage). Most NO.b neurons integrate inputs from the MB, as their names indicate (see \citep{eschbach2021circuits}).

The MB is shown in magenta, and the volume circumscribing NO.b and therefore defining the Noduli is highlighted in dark blue under the MB}
        \label{NOneurons}
    \end{figure}

    In addition to the 21 NO.b neurons described above, I identified approximately 92 neurons whose dendrites are located within the putative noduli (henceforth NO.d neurons). These NO.d neurons arise from a variety of larval lineages and can be grouped by their predominant connectivity and putative function. The major classes are: MB-related inputs and feedback neurons (many MB2INs/M2ONs/FBNs and convergence neurons(CNs) that convey learned-valence and feedback signals to the NO); LAL-projecting neurons that route processed NO signals to premotor or integrative centers; descending/SEZ-projecting neurons that relay NO-processed information toward motor circuits; and a small set of ascending or sensory-associated neurons that provide multisensory context.

    \begin{table}[h!][H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l r}
    \toprule
    Class & Approx. count \\
    \midrule
    MB-related inputs (MBINs, FBNs, CNs) & 38 \\
    Local interneurons / recurrent NO circuitry & 20 \\
    LAL-projecting neurons & 12 \\
    Descending / SEZ-projecting neurons & 10 \\
    Ascending / sensory-associated inputs & 7 \\
    Unclassified / other & 5 \\

    \caption[Summary of NO.d neurons]{Approximate classification and counts of neurons with dendrites in the larval noduli (NO.d).}
    \label{NOd_summary}
    \end{table}

    Functionally, the large fraction of MB-related NO.d neurons indicates that the they neurons are a implicated in memory-modulated signals in the larva. The presence of many LAL- and descending-projecting NO.d neurons supports the idea that the noduli contribute to transforming MB-gated sensory or internal-state information into action-related commands.
    Not a single NO.d neuron projects its axon onto any of the other core larval central complex neuropil, but some project to the LAL (Table \ref{inputsoutputs}), supporting a role for the NO as an output neuropil of the central complex.

\section{Mushroom Body and the larval CX}
    \label{CXMB}
    In the adult \textbf{Drosophila}, the Mushroom Body is known to output onto the Central Complex neuropils through the MB Output Neurons (MBONs). At this stage, adult MBONs primarily target the Fan-shaped Body - tangential neurons from the middle layers (4-6) - and the Noduli - via a direct glutamatergic connection from MBON-30 to LCNOp(LAL–NO) neurons which then target the PFN (PB-FB-NO) neurons \citep{hulse2021connectome}.Here, I examine the synaptic relationships between mushroom body input (DANs, MBINs, OANs) and output (MBONs) neurons and the larval central complex neuropils.

        \label{MBtoCX}
    \end{figure}
    
    \subsubsection{A loop between FB and the 'c' compartment of the MB}
    
    I found that MBON-c1 synapses onto one FB.b neuron, MB2ON-125.
    Interestingly, DAN-c1 integrates inputs from an FB.d neuron, FFN-6, which in turn integrates inputs from a few neurons that are directly postsynaptic to MB2ON-125, defining a loop between the MB 'c' compartment and the FB.
    No other MBON supplies direct or two-hop inputs onto the FB.

   
    \subsubsection{Reciprocal connectivity between EB ring neurons and the 'g' compartment of the MB}

    Four MBONs (a2, b3, g1 and g2) are EB.b (i.e., deliver synapses to the EB; Fig. \ref{MBtoCX}). Interestingly, some of these MBONs are monosynaptically interrelated, namely MBON-g1 and -g2 (which promote approach) are GABAergic neurons that synapse onto MBON-a2 (which promote avoidance) \citep{eschbach2021circuits}.
    Furthermore, MBON-g1 and -g2 synapse axo-axonically onto an EB ring neuron, RN1/2 (also known as FBN-20; \citep{eschbach2021circuits}), a core GABAergic neuron of the EB, which in addition to synapting axo-axonically recyprocally onto EB wedge neurons also synapses onto an EB.d neuron, DAN-g1.
    Therefore, the output of the MB 'g' compartment (MBON-g1 and -g2) modulate, with GABA, the axon of an EB ring neuron (RN1/2), which in turn synapses onto the dendrites of the teaching neuron of the MB 'g' compartment (DAN-g1).  This circuit configuration defines a close relationship between an associative learning compartment (MB 'g') and the EB.

    Assuming the larval ring neurons RN1/2 are also GABAergic, as they are in the adult \citep{hanesch1989neuronal}, the MB 'g' compartment is providing disinhibitory input onto the EB, by means of MBON-g1/g2 inhibiting its ring neurons.
    This disinhibition could be understood as a learning-based gating mechanism over EB wedge neurons, with features of input space expressed in the Kenyon cell population code, by coincident activity with DAN-g1, modulating the activity of the EB wedge neurons that the ring neurons also synapse onto.
    Taken together, this implies that, if the larval EB is functionally similar to that of the adult EB, there is a component of learning built-in into the internal representation of the direction of movement.
    
    \subsubsection{A loop between the NO and the MB vertical lobe via the LAL}
    % All are axo-dendritic synapses:
    % MBON-p1 (NO.b) -> FBN-24/25/27 (NO.d) -> MBIN-l1

    MBON-p1 is a multi-compartment MBON of the MB vertical lobe that is an NO.b, (i.e., it delivers output synapses to the NO).
    At the NO, MBON-p1 synapses onto several NO.d neurons, FBN-24, FBN-25, and FBN-27, which are MB feedback neurons \citep{eschbach2020recurrent} that all project to the LAL and synapse strongly onto MBIN-l1, a MB input neuron targeting multiple compartments of the vertical lobe.
    This circuit configuration defines a strong tight loop between the MB vertical lobe and the NO via the LAL.  Note that the dendrites of MBIN-l1 are entirely contained within the LAL compartment.
    In addition, these three feedback neurons also synapse weakly onto DAN-d1.


    \subsubsection{The MB modulates inputs to the PB}
    % MBON-d1 -> MB2ON-63 (PB.b) -> multiple PB.d (some are NO.b like MB2ON-241)
    % CN-53, CN-54, MB2ON-175 all synapse onto DALv1 neurons

    % VISUAL input to the PB and the EB
    Multiple sensory modalities converge onto the horizontal fibers of the PB (DALv1 neurons) via MB convergence neurons (CN-53, CN-54) and a neuron postsynaptic to MBONs (MB2ON-175).
    These CNs were previously described as integrating the output of both the lateral horn (LH), which conveys innate pathways, and the mushroom body (MB), for associative memory \citep{eschbach2021circuits}.
    Synapses from CN-53, CN-54 and MB2ON-175 onto PB horizontal fiber neurons (DALv1) follow an intriguing pattern of synapting onto either the dendrite or the axon, but largely not both, with specific target choices among the 4 DALv1 neurons.
    In considering that 3 of the 4 DALv1 neurons (PB horizontal fibers) present an unusual bilateral axon that first deploys output synapses contralaterally and then ipsilaterally (Fig. \ref{fig:dalv1neurons}A), the observed pattern of selective axo-dendritic and axo-axonic connections has implications for the modulation of the output of the unusual axons of DALv1 neurons.

    In summary, from the perspective of the PB, I find the following circuit architecture: the multi-sensory convergence onto the PB horizontal fibers is directly modulated by the MB, precisely because the neurons that mediate the multi-sensory convergence are themselves CNs (i.e., integrate also MBON synapses in addition to LH inputs): the CN-53 and CN-54. %Both of these neurons are also Lateral Horn (LH) neurons.
    Note CN-54 is in addition a PB.d neuron, integrating inputs from PB horizontal fibers (DALv1 neurons).

    Upstream, among various MBONs, MBON-c1 is the most strongly connected to both CN-53 and CN-54, which also integrate inputs from MBON-b1 and MBON-b2. All three are MBONs of the MB peduncle; MBON-c1 has no known function, while MBON-b1 and MBON-b2 promote approach \citep{eschbach2021circuits}.

    Of note, the axon of MBON-c1 receives direct presumably inhibitory (GABAergic) inputs from MBON-g1, MBON-g2, and MBON-d1, with all three MBONs participating of circuit loops with other central complex neuropils.

    Additionally, neurons directly postsynaptic to MBONs, such as MB2ON-175, in turn directly synapse onto the horizontal fibers of the PB, either axo-axonically or axo-dendritically, in a pattern selective of specific DALv1 neurons.

    In summary, not only are navigational decisions - such as whether to turn towards a stimuli or not- proceeding co-dependently per sensory modality but they are also integrated across modalities, an observation that is in line with previous behavioral experiments \citep{gepner2015computations}. Importantly, this integration is modulated by prior memories. (vis the MB).

    % Blue photoreceptors -> Visual PN (PVL09) -> MB2ON-187 (TuBu?) -> EBa1 ring neurons (DALv23)
    In the adult, the EB is known to receive visual inputs via a polysynaptic pathway (see Fig. 6 in \citep{hulse2021connectome}, and Fig. 4 in \citep{omoto2018neuronal}). In the larva, I find that the main visual PN for negative phototaxis, PVL09 \citep{Humberg2018PVL09}, synapses axo-dendritically onto MB2ON-187, which relays sensory inputs from visual and other sensory modalities axo-axonically onto larval Wedge neurons and Ring neurons (Fig. \ref{visualPBEB}).
    MB2ON-187 is named so for being postsynaptic to MBONs (MBON-c1 in particular; \citep{eschbach2021circuits}).
    Through MB2ON-187, multiple sensory PNs (PVL09, mgPN 7) and many neurons postsynaptic to MBONs (MB2ONs) synapse onto Wedge neurons (see Suppl. Connectivity Matrix).
    The latter indicate, again, that MBONs modulate or filter sensory inputs converging onto the EB.

        \label{DANs}
    \end{figure}

Dopaminergic release outside the MB in the adult fly is known to trigger sleep via dorsal FB (dFB) neurons~\citep{pimentel2016sleep}, among other potential roles, depending upon the dopamine receptors expressed in the postsynaptic neurons and the circuits the neurons are part of.

The larval MB houses 7 pairs of DANs \citep{eichler2017complete}, with several more DANs scattered across the brain \citep{selcho2009thgal4}. By flp-out of the TH-GAL4 expression pattern that encompasses all DANs \citep{selcho2009thgal4} followed by immunohistochemistry, I isolated individual neurons from the TH-GAL4 expression patteern and compared their morphology with EM-reconstructed brain neurons \citep{winding2023connectome}. I identified with reasonable certainty the following 5 eDAN types (eDAN for \textit{external} DAN, i.e., not a MB DAN), comprising 6 neuron pairs.

\textbf{eDAN-1}: from the larval lineage DPMpm2, this neuron presents an ipsilateral dendrite in the posterior-dorsal brain, and a bilateral axon exactly overlapping with HF-PB dendrites. eDAN-1 integrates inputs from PB.d neurons like CN-54 (which mediates multi-sensory input integration and relays them to HF-PB, modulated by MB output; see above) but also from multiple sensory PNs such as for temperature (Suckerfish PN, Thermo PN 3 and Thermo PN 5), olfaction (mPN A3), and for unknown sensory modalities (Suckerfish PN 2, from unknown sensory MN-Sens-B2-ACp-21 and -22; \citep{miroschnikow2018convergence}), and also from PB.b neurons like MB2ON-63. The axon of eDAN-1 synapses onto multiple PB.d neurons (MB2ON-187, CN-15, CN-54, ADC1, FB-LAL1, and SP2-1) and weakly onto HF-PB neurons.

\textbf{eDAN-2}: from the larval lineage CM4-dm, this DAN presents a small, compact ipsilateral dendrite and a contralateral axon on the corresponding contralateral hemisphere right at the posterior end of the FB. eDAN-2 integrates inputs from FB neurons (strongly from FB.d.6, hs-FB.3, hs-FB.1, and weakly from many more). Its axon synapses onto MB2IN-195 (which is presynaptic to EB Wedge neurons), multiple FB neurons (hs-FB.3, hs-FB.1, FB.d.7 (FFN-6)), and weakly onto MB2IN-191 (the octopaminergic VUM of the CX).

\textbf{eDAN-3}: also known as MB2IN-139 \citep{eschbach2021circuits}, this neuron is from the larval lineage DPMpl12. Its dendrite is ipsilateral, sitting lateral to the FB but also extending into the LAL. The eDAN-3 axon targets a region dorsal to the LAL, housing the dendrites of  many EB.d neurons onto which it synapses, such as MB2IN-114, EB-DN1, MB2ON-17, EB wedge neurons (only W1), and many more neurons such as convergence neurons (CN-30, CN-37, CN-38, CN-41, CN-42, CN-43), MB2ON-256, and a peculiar FB.d.1 neuron (Bushy).

\textbf{eDAN-4}: this type consists of two nearly identical neurons that share most inputs but differ only slightly in their outputs, since their axons are juxtaposed but tiled medio-laterally. From the larval lineage DPMpl12, they present an ipsilateral dendrite in the posterior ventral brain and a contralateral axon in the posterior intermediate brain, beyond the limits of the FB proper. Both integrate inputs from numerous EB.d neurons like MB2IN-124, but only eDAN-4l (lateral axon) receives synapse from hs-FB.3. The axons of both eDAN-4 synapse onto some NO.d neurons like MB2ON-248 (whose dendrite has a domain in the NO and another outside where it meets the axon of both eDAN-4) and of other unidentified neurons (lasso-top 3, DALcm12-v descending), but only eDAN-4l synapses onto convergence neurons (CN-9, CN-26), and only eDAN-4m synapses onto hs-FB.5 and hs-FB.7.

\textbf{eDAN-5}: from the DPMpm1 larval lineage, this neuron's dendrite lays posterior to the LAL and projects its axon inside the lateral LAL. The dendrite integrates inputs from EB.d neurons, MB2IN-195, MB2ON-67, and sVUM2mx. The axon targets weakly but axo-dendritically an EB Ring neuron (RN1/2), and more strongly other neurons (MB2ON-67, MB2ON-78, MB2ON-68).

According to \citep{selcho2009thgal4} there are further non-MB DANs yet to be identified in the larval brain connectome. Note an effort was made to relate the eDANs I could identify to non-MB DAN names in \citep{selcho2009thgal4} but the resolution mismatch was too great to bridge, except for eDAN-1 which is most likely named "DM3" in \citep{selcho2009thgal4}.

    I identified genetic driver lines for eight neurons of the larval central complex: EB-MB1, PB2, LAL-DN1, LAL wrap1, FB-NO1, EB-DN1, RN1/2, plus DAN-d1, which is an EB.d (i.e., integrates inputs from the EB). 
    I quantified larval turning behavior following targeted inhibition of each of these driver lines via Tetanus neurotoxin (TNT).
    Control animals expressed the inactive variant, Impotent Tetanus (ImpTNT).
    Given that the central complex is classically implicated in visually guided navigation, I used green light stimulation as the sensory stimuli.

    I found that expressing TNT did not show significant changes to turning rates for most neurons when compared to controls in response to green light stimulation, with the exception of DAN-d1 \ref{LOS}.

\section{Calcium Activity in response to Blue Light stimulation}
I was curious if the identified putative central comlpex would be responsive to light stimulation. 
I monitored the activity across the entire larval brain in response to stimulation of Rh5 (blue senstitive) phtoreceptors. Photoreceptors (the Bolwig Organ) are located outside of the Central Nervous System(CNS) of Drosophila. I thus expressed EGFP fluorescent tag in these neurons(Rh5s) to ensure they are present during dissection of the CNS and that they are preserved for mounting the sample in the glass capilary prior to Calcium Imaging. I created a final line that expresses green fluorescent RGECO (a calcium indicator of neural activity present cytosl) and red fluorescent IRFP (which brightens the cell nuclei very well and allows visualisation of cell position) and green fluorescent Rh5 photoreceptors. 

Upon blue light stimulation, robust calcium transients in multiple regions of the larval brain were observed. Amongst the CX neuropils, I expected the neuropil with the most visual input (Protocerebral Bridge) to be realiably responsive to photoreceptors. To test this, the brain was segmented into distinct anatomical regions using manual annotation. Regions corresponding to the optic lobe (OL) - to confirm functional photoreceptors - the putative Protocerebral Bridge, and the MB - as a control -  were delinated (Fig. \ref{LSSegmentation}).
based on anatomical landmarks and lineage tracing data. Flu orescence intensity changes $\Delta F/F_0$ were quantified for each region before, during and after blue light stimulation. 

   \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=10cm]{Figs/CX/LSSegmentation.pdf}
        \caption[Lightsheet volume Segmentation]{Lightsheet Volume Segmentation}
        \label{LSSegmentation}
    \end{figure}

The Optic Lobe (OL) was reliably activated in response to light in sample 1,3 and 5 samples which confirms intact and functional photoreceptors. For sample 2 the left OL significanlty less responsive than the right, indicating possible tissue damage on that side of the brain. Similarly for sample 4 the right side is less responsive than the left. 
Notably, across all samples, the OL exhibited a markedly larger $\Delta F/F_0$ response compared to other regions of interest, creating a masking effect in data visualization. Specifically, the large amplitude of OL activity expanded the y-axis range, compressing the apparent variability in other regions and obscuring meaningful differences between the PB and the MB. To better resolve the relative dynamics among the remaining regions, the OL traces were excluded from subsequent analysis and the data was replotted and presented side by side with the original in figure \ref{LSanalysis}.

        \centering

        \label{LSanalysis}
    \end{figure}


When compared to the control (MB), the larval Protocerebral Bridge (PB) exhibited higher amplitude calcium transients in samples 2, 4, and 5, whereas both neuropils showed similar activity in samples 1 and 3. Interestingly, the two samples with one inactive optic lobe (samples 2 and 4) displayed a more pronounced difference between PB and MB activity, suggesting that unilateral OL impairment may enhance the relative responsiveness of the PB to visual stimulation. This observation may indicate compensatory mechanisms or altered circuit dynamics in the presence of partial sensory deprivation. 
Overall, there seems to be a higher sensitivity to blue light from in PB compared to the MB, supposrting the hypothesis of a functional role in visual input processing (Fig. \ref{LSanalysis}). However, the effects aren't as significant as expected, possibly due to small sample size, suggesting the experiment could be underpowered.
