4. TODO add section descending neurons (DNs) and the association of CX
structures with known DNs.
5. TODO Discussion section on learning and DANs, related to DNs.

7. TODO make supplemental connectivity matrices, axo-axonic,
axo-dendritc etc. with the Export tool.

8. FB.d figure
9. NO.d figure
10. eDANs figure: two figures, on anatomy and connectivity, and on
immunohistochemistry
11. More cartoons explaining little vignettes of circuit motifs across
the board, like for eDANs, and for whatever else can help relate to the
PEN, PFN, etc names of neurons in Hulse et al.



Doing 
12. a table of .b rows vs .d columns for each neuropil could be clarifying, perhaps reveal some non-obvious structure.

Done
13. Sensory inputs to CX, one graph redone them all.  
14. Table with side by side neurons - TODO make an effort to collect main cell types from the adult and
assign them to larval ones, by the collection of neuropils they synapse
to/from.
