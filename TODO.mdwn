#RESULTS
2. EB.d neurons not listed in the EB section (additional)
8. FB.d figure
9. NO.d figure

4. Descending neurons (DNs) and the association of CX
structures with known DNs.
10. eDANs connectivity

12. a table of .b rows vs .d columns for each neuropil could be clarifying, perhaps reveal some non-obvious structure.
1. Proprioceptive ascending inputs

7. Make supplemental connectivity matrices, axo-axonic,
axo-dendritc etc. with the Export tool.

#DISCUSSION
5. TODO Discussion section on learning and DANs, related to DNs.
3.  integrate Kandimalla et al. 2023

#EXTRA
11. More cartoons explaining little vignettes of circuit motifs across
the board, like for eDANs, and for whatever else can help relate to the
PEN, PFN, etc names of neurons in Hulse et al.
13. add a \section{Visual input into the Larval Central Complex}%- 4 graphs showing connectivity between
