\section{The Central Complex}
The Central Complex(CX) is a morphologically conserved set of neuropils found across insects
%(bumblebee, the red flour beetle and the Monarch butterfly) 
that acts as navigational centre and sensory integration area for coordinated motor activity.
This region is best described %(connectivity wise) 
and understood %(function wise) 
in \textit{Drosophila} adult where its core functions include multisensory navigational decisions, path integration, allocentric orientation of the head relative to its body - convergence of head and body direction - and providing an internal sense of direction in the absence of stimuli. %also promotes sleep

At the larval stage, this animal exhibits  similar behaviours to those observed in the adult: it demonstrates chemotaxis during foraging and performs aversive phototaxis in response to blue light. In addition to individual stimulus response, \textit{Drosophila} larva is able to integrate competing stimuli into a coherent representation(Gepner et al.,2015) prior to decision making. The larval brain shares similar set of neuroblasts with the adult, and presents neuropils with direct correspondance to the adult such as the Antennal Lobe(AL), the Mushroom Body(MB), and the Lateral Accessory Lobe(LAL). 

The underlying connectivity of AL, MB, LAL is well understood at present(Winding et al., 2023), as well as the Lateral Horn(LH; a larvae specific neuropil). Nevertheless, these structures constitute only up to 25\% of the larval brain connectome. We postulate that amongst the remaining ~75\% of neurons, a multitude should be devoted to navigational decisions, and may constitute the putative larval Central Complex neuropils. These are unlikely to be reocgnizable morphologically at this stage of development, since the brain lobes aren't yet fused at the midline, and the larval brain presents a commisure. The basis of our search has to be, in turn, based on lineage membership, relative spatial location and circuit architecure specific to adult central complex neuropils. We use all three in an iterative process to progressively find putative CX neurons.


The adult \textit{\textit{Drosophila}} central complex has five neuropils: the Protocerebral Bridge (PB), the Fan-shaped Body (FB; or central body upper), the Ellipsoid body(EB; or central body lower), the Noduli (NO) ~\citep{hanesch1989neuronal} and, as of recently, the Assymetrical Body (AB) ~\citep{wolff2018neuroarchitecture}. The Lateral Accessory Lobe (LAL) reciprocally interconnects with these, making it an important accesory structure and reference point. 

The central complex has been associated with a set of functions - spatial navigation decisions, directed locomotion and sleep - some of which are shared by the larva. The neuroblasts that give rise to the neuronal lineages populating the adult CX also exist in the larval brain. A subset of embryonic-born neurons remain undifferentiated throughout larval stages and delineate the structures of the adult CX, acting as pioneer neurons during metamorphosis 
~\citep{andrade2019developmentally}; however, earlier-born, differentiated neurons of the same lineages contribute to structures in the larval brain. The question remains as to what structures. Furthermore, the larval brain presents readily recognizable neuropils of accepted homology with the adult brain, including the antennal lobe ~\citep{berck2016wiring}, mushroom body ~\citep{eichler2017complete}, and lateral accessory lobe ~\citep{hartenstein2015lineage}.
 In the adult brain, the central complex neuropils are primarily medial structures, suggesting that any putative larval counterpart will be necessarily split across the midline given the lack of fusion of the larval brain hemispheres. With all the above in mind, and considering the evolution of the larval stage in holometabolous insects ~\citep{truman1999origins}and the presence of a central complex-like structure in the larva of the holometabolous beetle Tribolium castaneum, we set out to identify the putative central complex neuropils of the fruit fly larva on the basis of: neurons contributing to the larval CX neuropils that share lineage of origin with the adult CX neurons;the synaptic connectivity present across the putative larval CX neuropils is at least a subset of that of the adult CX neuropils; the spatial position and overall morphology of the arbors of larval CX neuropils is similar to that of the adult CX neurons.
